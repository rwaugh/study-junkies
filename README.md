# Study Junkies
A learning application to curate and collect ideas as a resource for other applications

We read books and articles. We listen to podcasts and radio. We watch lectures and documentaries. For all we remember we might as well meditate beneath a waterfall. Very little penetrates and does so randomly.

We need to dispel the illusion of learning.

We want to find good ideas, pack those ideas up and make use of them in daily life.
1. Start with a source text and transform it into constituent ideas that link back to the source.
2. Take those ideas and parse them into questions of varying difficulty.
3. Create a multitude of applications that use the quiz information individually and collectively.
